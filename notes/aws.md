# Launching a Virtual Machine at Amazon Web Services

The goal of this lecture-lab is to teach you to create a Linux machine at *Amazon Web Services*, login and copy some data to that machine.


Here is a video I made for MSAN692 showing [how to launch an AWS instance and start a Python-based web server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQncEJL6NHs&t=2s).

##  Discussion

Login to AWS and go to your [AWS console](http://aws.amazon.com/console) and click on the "EC2" link under "All services":

<img src=images/console_snippet.png width=200>

(Or click the "Launch a virtual machine" button.)

Click "Launch Instance", which will start the process to create a virtual machine in the cloud. An instance is just a virtual machine.

<img src=images/launch.png width=400>

Select the "Amazon Linux 2 AMI" entry, which should be the first one.  This is a commonly-used "image" that results in a Linux machine that contains lots of useful goodies as you can see from that list, such as Python and MySQL. An image is just a snapshot of the disk after someone carefully installs software properly on a Linux machine. This means we don't have to install software every time we create a new machine.

Or for machine learning and deep learning use this image:

<img src=images/ami-DL.png width=600>

Select instance type "t2.micro," which should be the first machine type listed. This machine is very low powered but is sufficient for playing around. Click the "Review and launch" button at the bottom.

<img src=images/selectvm.png width=600>

This will bring up a screen describing the details about the instance we are launching. Ignore all of it for now and just click "Review and Launch" at the bottom right. That brings up a summary page that we could examine if we wanted, but just click "Launch" in bottom right.

This will bring a dialog box up to select a key pair. A key pair is what allows you to securely access the server and prevent unauthorized access. The *first time*, you will need to create a new key pair. Name it as your user ID then click on "Download key pair."  It will download a *userid*.pem file, which are your security credentials for getting into the machine. Save that file in a safe spot. If you lose it you will not be able to get into the machine that you create. From now on, you can reuse that pre-existing key.

<img src=images/keypair.png width=600>

After downloading, click "Launch instances." You should see something like:

<img src=images/launched.png width=600>

Click on the `i-...` link to go to the EC2 console showing your instance. On that page click on your instance's checkbox, which then looks something like:

<img src=images/ec2-instance.png width=600>

You should see a description box at the bottom. Look for the "Public IPv4 IP" address, which is 54.177.198.89 in this case. (We have to wait until the status stops saying "Initializing", which could take several minutes.)

## Connecting to the remote server

Click on the "Connect" button at the top of the page and it will bring up a dialog box that tells you how to connect to the server.  You want to connect with an "SSH client" link. Inside you will see the `ssh` command necessary to connect to your cloud machine from your laptop's terminal. (If you have Windows, you will have to use an SSH client called PuTTY instead of `ssh`.)

<img src=images/connect.png width=450>

Before we can connect, we have to make sure that the *userid*`.pem` security file you saved above is not visible to everyone on the computer (other users). Otherwise ssh will not let us connect because the security file is not secure. You will get this error:

```bash@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0644 for '/Users/parrt/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
bad permissions: ignore key: /Users/parrt/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem
Permission denied (publickey).
```

Whoa!  Do this:

```bash
$ cd ~/Dropbox/licenses # or wherever you saved your file
$ ls -l parrt.pem
-rw-r--r--@ 1 parrt  parrt  1696 Aug  4 15:15 /Users/parrt/Dropbox/licences/parrt.pem
```

To fix the permissions, we can use whatever "show information about file" GUI your operating system has or, from the command line, do this:

```bash
$ cd ~/Dropbox/licenses
$ chmod 400 parrt.pem
```

which changes the permissions like this:

```bash
$ ls -l parrt.pem
-r--------@ 1 parrt  501  1696 Aug  1 12:12 /Users/parrt/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem
```

Don't worry if you don't understand exactly what's going on there. It's basically saying that the file is only readable for me, the current user, with no permissions to anybody else.

For mac and linux users, we will use the direct `ssh` command from the command line. It will be something like:

```bash
ssh -i parrt.pem ec2-user@54.177.198.89
```

Naturally, you will have to provide the full pathname to your *userid*.pem file. So I need to type:

```bash
ssh -i ~/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem ec2-user@54.177.198.89
```

Try to connect again and it will now warn you that you have never connected to that machine before. Again, this is a security measure. You can simply say "yes" here.

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem ec2-user@54.177.198.89

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-71 ~]$ 
```

The `$` is your prompt just like you have on your local machine using the terminal / shell, but you are giving commands to a remote server not your local machine.



## Multiple shells

You can either hit "command-T" from Terminal.app and get multiple tabs up, one for the remote host and one for local/laptop work:

<img src="images/tabs.png" width="600">

Or just get two windows up using "command-N" from Terminal.app.

<img src="images/two-shells.png" width="600">

Verify the remote computer is not your laptop by doing command `ls /` on both computers:

<img src="images/two-roots.png" width="600">
 
## Uploading data or code

To get data up to the server, you can cut-and-paste if the file is small. For example,  cut-and-paste the following data into a file called `coffee` in your home directory on that remote computer. First copy this data from these notes:

```bash
3 parrt
2 jcoker
8 tombu
```

then launch the `nano` editor on the remote computer:

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-71 ~]$ nano coffee
```

Paste the data into that file and type control-X and then "Yes" to save the file. You should pop back to the prompt after exiting.

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-71 ~]$ cat coffee # print it back out
3 parrt
2 jcoker
8 tombu
$ 
```

For larger files, we need to use the secure copy `scp` command that has the same argument structure as secure shell `ssh`. Get another shell running on your laptop. Download data file [cheese_deaths.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parrt/msan501/master/projects/regression/data/cheese_deaths.csv) and store on your laptop in the directory where you are currently working on the laptop command line. Now, in a shell **on your laptop**, use the following command (that is similar to `ssh`) to copy it to the remote computer:

```bash
$ scp -i ~/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem cheese_deaths.csv ec2-user@54.177.198.89:~ec2-user
cheese_deaths.csv                                100%  160     6.9KB/s   00:00
$ 
```

Do not forget the `~ec2-user` on the end of that line.  The general form of the command is:

scp -i *your-pem-file* *file-to-copy* *user*@*machine-name*:*directory-on-remote-machine*

From the shell that is connected to the remote server, ask for the directory listing and you will see the new file:

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-71 ~]$ ls
cheese_deaths.csv
[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-71 ~]$ head cheese_deaths.csv 
years,cheese,deaths
2000,29.8,327
2001,30.1,456
2002,30.5,509
2003,30.6,497
2004,31.3,596
2005,31.7,573
2006,32.6,661
2007,32.7,809
2008,32.8,717
```

To exit the remote server, type `exit` or use `^D` from the `$` prompt. The machine will still be running but you're no longer connected to it from your laptop.

## Firewall

We can start up a web server on this computer, but it is not reachable from the outside world unless we open up at least one of the ports protected by the firewall. In other words, the server might be listening at a port, but the outside world cannot reach that port.

To change the firewall, go back to the page listing your instance(s) and select the security tab associated with your instance:

<img src="images/security-tab.png" width=400>

Click on `launch wizard` under the security groups section in the information describing your instance. It will open up a section of the webpage and then click on the `inbound rules` tab, if it's not already selected. It should look like this:

<img src="images/inbound.png" width=400>

Notice that port 22 (SSH) is open. Otherwise we could not of connected to the computer.

Click the "Edit inbound rules" button and then click "Add Rule".  This will open up a new inbound rule line. Set the port number to 5000, which is where we often put our play servers, and then specify the "Source" as `0.0.0.0/0`, meaning anybody can connect. It should look like this:

<img src="images/addrule.png" width=500>

Click the "Save rules" button. And now port 5000 should be open through the firewall, but of course we have not started a server listening at that port and so we cannot connect to that port at this point. We will learn how to create servers in MSDS692 but for now we can use a built-in Python Web server.  To launch a basic web server on port 5000 on the Amazon machine, type this on the terminal connected to the Amazon machine:

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-71 ~]$ $ python3 -m http.server --cgi 5000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 5000 (http://0.0.0.0:5000/) ...
```

Then, go to a browser on your laptop and open URL `http://54.177.198.89:5000/` but make sure to replace `54.177.198.89` with the public IP address of your specific Amazon machine. It might not be an IP address, it might be a name with a bunch of dots and numbers. The browser should look something like

<img src="images/simple-server.png" width=200>

and the simple Web server at Amazon should report the following in the terminal:

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-30-0-71 ~]$ python3 -m http.server --cgi 5000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 5000 (http://0.0.0.0:5000/) ...
154.21.212.170 - - [16/Jun/2021 19:26:08] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
154.21.212.170 - - [16/Jun/2021 19:26:09] code 404, message File not found
154.21.212.170 - - [16/Jun/2021 19:26:09] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

You can kill that server with control-C (^C), which gets you back to the remote terminal. Then type `exit` or `^D` to exit the remote terminal.

## Terminate when done

Play around with your instance and then **TERMINATE YOUR INSTANCE WHEN YOU ARE DONE**, otherwise you will continue to get charged for the use of that machine. Right-click on the instance from your AWS console and select  "terminate instance". It will warn you that all of your local storage will go away. Hit the "yes, terminate" button.  Once it is successfully terminated, you should no longer see the instance in your EC2 instance list.

If you say "stop" instead, it will stop the machine, but you still get charged, but just a little for the storage associated with that machine. On the other hand, this is useful because you can restart that machine without having to go through this whole procedure. All of your data will be intact. If you say "Terminate", it will toss the machine out and you will have to go through this procedure again to get a new machine.
