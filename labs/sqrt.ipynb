    "# Approximating square root iteratively\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of useful functions that have no closed form solution, meaning we can't just do a computation and return the value. Instead, we need to use an iterative method to approximate the function value. It's an extremely useful pattern that will come in handy later in this program and in your professional life. We can use iterative computing to approximate sine (with Taylor series expansion), approximate square root (as we'll do in this lecture), or optimize a cost or error function (gradient descent in the introduction to machine learning course).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to translate a recurrence relation, that yields a sequence of values, to Python.  Instead of computing and returning a single value, we will look for **convergence of the series**. In other words, if we run the series out far enough, $x_{i+1}$ will be close to $x_i$ leaving $x_i$ as  a very accurate approximation of square root. This will teach us the basics of iterative computing and prepare us for  more complicated function optimization material needed later."
