# Basic files lab

The goal of this lab is to get a basic familiarity with reading and writing text and binary files using Python. It's also an opportunity to use commandline arguments passed to Python scripts via `sys.argv`.

## Copying text files

Let's combine the code from the files lecture for both reading and writing text files to create a script that knows how to copy files from the command line. Of course, we would normally use `cp` from the commandline, but let's use Python so we can learn about reading and writing files.

So we have a text file to copy, download [prices.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parrt/msds501/master/data/prices.txt) from our course repository and save in a directory that you'd like to use for labs. Here's how you can create an appropriate directory from the commandline:

```bash
$ cd ~/classes/msds501
$ mkdir -p labs/files
$ cd labs/files
```
After saving the file you can check to ensure the file is in the appropriate directory:

```bash
$ ls
prices.txt
$ 
```

The goal here is to create a script that lets us copy files as follows.

```bash
$ python copytxt.py prices.txt /tmp/foo.txt
```

That command should copy the `prices.txt` file up into the `/tmp` directory.

To get started, create a Python script called `copytxt.py` in that same directory. The script should start out by getting the source and target file names from the commandline argument list:

```python
import sys

src = sys.argv[1]
trg = sys.argv[2]
```

Go back to the files lecture and type in code that will open the `src` file,  read in the contents to a string variable, then write that content back out to the `trg` file.

You can test your code by performing a copy and then using the `diff` command to compare the source and target files.

```bash
$ python copytxt.py prices.txt /tmp/foo.txt
$ diff prices.txt /tmp/foo.txt
$ 
```

We get no output from `diff`, indicating that there is no difference between the original file and the target. If you get stuck, here is the [solution](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/labs/code/files/copytxt.py).

## Copying any kind of file

In order to load a text file, Python must interpret the numbers in the file as characters.  This conversion from numbers to characters is rather complicated, and we will discuss this in detail in data acquisition. For now, please keep in mind that Python reads text files with some decoding operations. On the other hand, if we tell Python the file is "binary," then Python won't do any interpretation at all and will just load bytes of data.

To expose this, let's download an Excel spreadsheet, [cars.xls](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/data/cars.xls?raw=true), which is definitely not a text file. It has numbers but also formatting and position information. When you load in Excel it looks like this:

<img src="images/cars.png" width="200">

But, the file on the disk is definitely not rows and columns of human readable numbers. You can verify that by running the `head` command from the terminal to look at the first few lines:

<img src="images/cars-head.png" width="300">

As you can see, that is definitely not human readable text. Try using the script we just wrote for text and you will see that Python gets a character decoding error:

```bash
$ python copytxt.py cars.xls /tmp/cars.xls
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "copytxt.py", line 10, in <module>
    contents = f.read()
  File "/Users/parrt/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/codecs.py", line 322, in decode
    (result, consumed) = self._buffer_decode(data, self.errors, final)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xd0 in position 0: invalid continuation byte
```

Ok, so we need to create a new version of the python script called `cp.py` that tells python file is an arbitrary binary file, and it should not do any character interpretation. By default, when you open a file, Python assumes you are reading from the file and that it is a text file: `open("foo")` is the same as `open("foo", mode="rt")`, where `r` means to open the file for reading and `t` means text.  To make this work for binary files, change the mode from `rt` to `rb`.  When writing the file, change the mode from `w` (or `wt`) to `wb`. Everything else in the script should be the same. Using the new script, we should get a faithful copy:

```bash
$ python cp.py cars.xls /tmp/cars.xls
$ open /tmp/cars.xls # open that file in Excel
```

If you get stuck, here is the [solution](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/labs/code/files/cp.py).

At this point, you've got the basic skills necessary to read and write text and binary files in Python!
